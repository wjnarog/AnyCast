# AnyCast

## Description
AnyCast is a new and exciting way to explore the weather brought to you by the members of group 08 in recitation 12. Many preexisting weather apps allow the user to check the weather either at their current location or by searching for a town or locality near them. AnyCast boldly breaks from this tradition by limiting user input and reducing decision anxiety. The two novel ways of interacting with AnyCast are either a randomizer button that transports the user to some spot on the Earthâ€™s surface or by entering the latitude and longitude of their desired location. This allows the user to interact with and get a taste of weather all around the globe in places they would not necessarily think or be able to visit. To keep the user comfortable in their weather exploration, we have also implemented a selection of 5 hand crafted avatars (buffalo, iguana, macaw, ferret, and koala) that any user with an account can choose from.
